% Script that shows an example of a canonical polynomial approximation using
% linear regression method. In the second part a custom function is built
% (instead of using the canonical polynomial).

y = [6.3806 7.1338 9.1662 11.5545 15.6414 22.7371 32.0696 47.0756 73.1596 111.4684 175.9895 278.5550 446.4441];

% Approximation polynomial degree.
degree = 3;

% A complete polynomial of degree 3 is built.
[a] = polyApprox (x, y, degree);
% Use our horner function to evaluate the polynomial.

% Using the two Octaves' native functions.
% Build the polynomial of degree equal to three.
[p] = polyfit (x, y, degree);
% Evaluate it in evalPoints.

% native functions coincide.

% Second part.

% Custom function:
% f(x) = f1*a1 + f2*a2 + f3*a3
f1 = 1 ./ ((1 + x) .^ 2);
f2 = 1 ./ ((1 + x) .^ 1);
f3 = 1 ./ ((1 + x) .^ 0);

% Since we have 3 functions, we have 3 unknowns, so the overall function degree
% is 2.
degree = 2;

m = length (x);
n = degree + 1;

% Build the linear regression matrix.
A = zeros (m, n);
% Thanks to vectorial notation we can do the following.
A = [f1', f2', f3'];

[f] = linearRegression (A, y);
[z2] = horner (f, evalPoints);
