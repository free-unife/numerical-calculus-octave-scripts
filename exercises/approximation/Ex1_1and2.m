% Script that shows an example of polynomial approximation using linear
% regression method.

x = [0 : 0.25 : 3];
y = [6.3806 7.1338 9.1662 11.5545 15.6414 22.7371 32.0696 47.0756 73.1596 111.4684 175.9895 278.5550 446.4441];
evalPoints = [0 : 0.1 : 3];

% Approximation polynomial degree.
degree = 3;

% A complete polynomial of degree 3 is built.
[a] = polyApprox (x, y, degree);
% Use our horner function to evaluate the polynomial.
[z0] = horner (a, evalPoints);

% Using the two Octaves' native functions.
% Build the polynomial of degree equal to three.
[p] = polyfit (x, y, degree);
% Evaluate it in evalPoints.
[z1] = polyval (p, evalPoints);

hold on

plot (x, y, 'b');
% As you can see from the graph, our calculation and the ones made by Octaves'
% native functions coincide.
plot (evalPoints, z1, 'r');
plot (evalPoints, z0, 'g');

hold off
