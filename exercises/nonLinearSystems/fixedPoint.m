% gFun = x - (fi(x) * f(x))
% with fi(x) usually = -1 or +1.
% The system is like this:
% { y = g(x)
% { y = x
%
% We are interested in f(x) = 0, so:
% if y = 0:
% { 0 = g(x)
% { x = 0
%
% Since g(x) = x - (fi(x) * f(x)) and assuming:
% fi(x) - 1, then:
% g(x) = 0 - (-1 * f(x))
%
% { 0 = f(x)
% { x = 0
%
% So the initial systems is the same as: f(x) = 0
