% Plot and find the zero of the function fun using the bisection method.
% Instead of making a new bisection function (because the exercise states
% to do that) we just use the already existing one, since there would be
% just little changes to make.

% If fun (a) and fun (b) have opposite signs, then bisection method can be
% applied. This is the Bolzano theorem. The convergence of this method is slow:
% you get 1 correct decimal digit every 3 iterations, so it should be used to
% get the small interval that contains the zero, not the zero itself. A more
% efficient method should be applied afterwards.
