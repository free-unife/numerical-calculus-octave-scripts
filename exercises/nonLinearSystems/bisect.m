% tol = int 1x1. }

% equal to zero (or at least a close approximation), it = the number of

		% It can be said like this: if fname(a) and fname(c) are both positive 
		% or negative, it means that x must be on the other side of the 
		% interval, so move the new a to the right side of the interval.
