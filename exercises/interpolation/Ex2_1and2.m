% Script that plots the function and its two lagrange polynomials (lineary
% spaced x and Chebyshev nodes) for different degrees. You can notice how bad
% is the Runge phenomenon in this case.

% WARNING: To be able to use this script on GNU Octave:
% From your package manager install: python-sympy
% Once you start your Octave instance: pkg install -forge symbolic
% Load the package: pkg load all
% You can put pkg load all in Octave's config file so that when it starts, it
% loads all packages (like this one) automatically.
