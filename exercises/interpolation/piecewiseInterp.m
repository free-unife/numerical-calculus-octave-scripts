% Function that calculates the polynomials (# >= 1 && # < #OfNodes), each of degree
% degreeOfSubpolys. The evaluation points are chosen between each sub-interval
% (depending on the polynomial number) with a step of evalPointsStep.
% The output of this function is an array p containing all the
% evaluated sub-polynomials, and another array evalPoints with all the
% evalPoints in each sub interval. This method is used to avoid Runge's
% phenomenon.

% I = { array x and y of nodes, degree of each sub-polynomial: degreeOfSubpolys,
% step of the lineary spaced evaluation points: evalPointsStep. }
% P = { x = 1xn, y = 1xn, 1 <= degreeOfSubpolys < length (x). }
% O = { p is the array containing all the pK (k-th evaluated polynomial
% between x(base) and x(limit)), evalPoints is the array containing all the
% evalPointsK (k-th array of evalPoints bewteen x(base) and x(limit)). }
% C = { p = [pI with: I = 0 : (at most) iterationNum], same for evalPoints. }

% Find the correct number of polynoms, based on the chosen degree and the
% number of input points. The following control is done to avoid index
% overflow. Remember that the iterations start from zero so 1 must be
% subtracted.

	% the correct degree if limit > #nodes.

	% accurate evaluation Chebyshev nodes should be used intead.

	% Build and evaluate the polynomials, each of degree degreeOfSubpolys,

	% nodes are passed to Newton's function.
