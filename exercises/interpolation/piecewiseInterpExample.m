% Script that shows how bad is Runge phenomenon at the bounds of a chosen
% interval for a famous function. The higher the degree, the worse Newton's
% polynomial is (red polynomial). A solution to this problem is using piecewise
% interpolation: lots of Newton's polynomials are used, but each one in a
% different subdomain of the original one. The result is sticked together and
% finally plotted (green polynomial). As you can see piecewise interpolaton is
% much better of the traditional one in these particular cases (comparison made
% with the blue line, i.e. the exact function).

% You can change the following variables and see what happens.

% Function definition. As you can notice, to have significant result input
% data, like function domain, x and y must remain the same in all three cases.
x = linspace (-1, 1, numberOfPoints);
%y = sin (pi * x);
y = 1 ./ (1 + (25 .* (x.^2)));
