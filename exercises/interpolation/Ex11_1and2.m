% Derivatives.

% Runge function derivative.
d0 = (- 50 * x0) ./ (((25 * x0.^2) + 1) .^ 2);

% Get f(x) spline structure.
[SplineStruct1] = spline (x1 ,y1);
% Get coefficient matrix C.
[nodes, C] = unmkpp (SplineStruct1);

% Calculation of the first order derivative coefficients.
% Since our cubic spline expression is like this:
% d * (x - xi)^3 + c * (x - xi)^2 + b * (x - xi) + a
% the first order derivative is:
% 3 * d  * (x - xi)^2 + 2 * c * (x - xi) + b
% with:
% x = nodes,
% xi = evalPoints
% { a, b, c, d } = { C(:, 4), C(:, 3), C(:, 2), C(:, 1) }
% We can calculate the static coefficients and overwite C.
% By doing this it is possible to calculate easily the first derivarive of the
% spline using cubicSpline.
C (:, 1) = C (:, 1) * 3;
C (:, 2) = C (:, 2) * 2;
C (:, 3) = C (:, 3);
C (:, 4) = 0;

% Get the first order derivative.
[d1] = cubicSpline (C, x1, evalPoints1, 1);

% Plot first derivative of Runge's function and of S1.
