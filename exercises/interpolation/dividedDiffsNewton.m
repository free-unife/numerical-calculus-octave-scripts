% Function that calculates the diagonal of the table of the divided
% differences. This is used because if we have a polynomial of degree n and we
% want to find the polinomial of degree n+1 (it has a new point (x(n+1),
% y(n+1)), we can use previous calculation (from degree 0 to n, to find n+1),
% instead of recalculating everything (all n+1).

% I = { x and y are the arrays containing the interpolation points of Newton. }
% P = { x = 1xn, y = 1xn. }
% O = { d = diagonal of the table. }
% C = { length (d) = length (x) = length (y) }


if length (x) ~= length (y)
	error ('Vector lengths must match.');
end;

n = length (x);
d = y;

% The divided differences are calculated column by column.
