Exercises in Octave/Matlab (m files).

##What this repository is about

This repository is just a collection of Octave/Matlab scripts and functions 
which you can freely use. Fell free to contribute.

To be able to run these scripts with Matlab you may need to change some 
instructions. These scripts, infact,  have only been trsted with GNU Octave, a 
free (as in freedom) version of Matlab. If you use Matlab you should switch to 
Octave instead and maybe even contribute to that project.
